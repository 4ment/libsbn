[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/matsengrp/bito/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/matsengrp/bito)

`bito`, or "Bayesian Inference of Trees via Optimization", is a Python-interface C++ library for phylogenetic variational inference so that you can express interesting parts of your phylogenetic model in Python/TensorFlow/PyTorch/etc and let Bito handle the tree structure and likelihood computations for you.
"Bito" is also the name of a [tree](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bito) native to Africa that produces medicinal oil.
We pronounce "bito" with a long /e/ sound ("bito" rhymes with "burrito").

This library is in an experimental state.
This library was formerly known as "libsbn".

## Dependencies

* If you are on linux, install gcc >= 7.5, which is standard in Debian Buster and Ubuntu 18.04
* If you are on OS X, use a recent version of Xcode and install command line tools

Then, install **the `hmc-clock` branch** of [BEAGLE](https://github.com/beagle-dev/beagle-lib).
This will require a from-source installation, as in their docs, but you have to do a full `git clone` (no `--depth=1`).
The BEAGLE install process is somewhat in flux, so it's best to look at the [conda-beagle Dockerfile](https://github.com/matsengrp/conda-beagle/blob/master/Dockerfile) and follow those steps.

To install additional dependencies, use the associated conda environment file:

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate bito

If you want to specify your compiler manually, set the `CC` and `CXX` shell variables to your desired compiler command.

The notebooks require R, IRKernel, rpy2 >=3.1.0, and some R packages such as ggplot and cowplot.
Do not install R via conda.
Doing so will install the conda compiler toolchain, this will mess up our compilation.


## Building

For your first build, do

* `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* `scons`
* Respond to interactive prompts about where `hmc-clock` BEAGLE is installed
* `conda activate bito` &nbsp; **(this is an important step, even though you are already in the bito conda environment)**
* `make`

After these steps `make` will build, run tests, and install the Python packages, and this should be the only command you need to run after modifying the code.

Note that `scons` and `make` accept `-j` flags for multi-core builds: e.g. `-j20` will build with 20 jobs.

The build process will modify the conda environment to point `[DY]LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to where BEAGLE is installed.
If you get an error about missing BEAGLE, just `conda activate bito` again and you should be good.
If you want to modify your desired BEAGLE installation location, do `unset BEAGLE_PREFIX` and start the steps above again starting at `scons`.

* (Optional) If you modify the lexer and parser, call `make bison`. This assumes that you have installed Bison > 3.4 (`conda install -c conda-forge bison`).
* (Optional) If you modify the test preparation scripts, call `make prep`. This assumes that you have installed ete3 (`conda install -c etetoolkit ete3`).

To build with cmake, do

* `mkdir build`
* `cd build`
* `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`
* `cmake --build . -j`
* `pip install .`

A minimum cmake version of 3.19 is required. Beagle will be automatically downloaded and built, and will be included in the pip package independently
of a system-wide installation. Currently GPU acceleration is not enabled for Beagle.
Debug or release builds can be selected with the `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=` option.
Convenience make targets exists for quickly building and testing with cmake. To perform a build, call `make cmakebuild`.
To run fast tests (and build if needed), call `make cmakefasttest`.

## Understanding

The following two papers will explain what this repository is about:

* Zhang & Matsen IV, NeurIPS 2018. [_Generalizing Tree Probability Estimation via Bayesian Networks_](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7418-generalizing-tree-probability-estimation-via-bayesian-networks.pdf); 👉🏽 [blog post](https://matsen.fredhutch.org/general/2018/12/05/sbn.html).
* Zhang & Matsen IV, ICLR 2019. [_Variational Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference_](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJVmjjR9FX_); 👉🏽 [blog post](https://matsen.fredhutch.org/general/2019/08/24/vbpi.html).

Our documentation consists of:

* [Online documentation](https://phylovi.github.io/bito/)
* Derivations in `doc/tex`, which explain what's going on in the code.
